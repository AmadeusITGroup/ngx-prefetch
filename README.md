## Description
In some cases, it is possible to prefetch the static resources of an application before actually loading the application itself. For example, if the application can be accessed through a static web page or another web application.

The prefetch builder generates a `ngxPrefetch.js` file that should be included in the HTML page of the entry point. When run, it dynamically [creates `<link>` tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Link_prefetching_FAQ) for each static resource (such as JS and CSS files) so that the browser can prefetch them during idle times. This will improve the Page Load Time of the application when it is actually loaded.

## Prerequisites
A prerequiste for the script is to have [Angular Service Worker](https://angular.io/guide/service-worker-intro) enabled as it is using the `ngsw.json` from the production build  folder that is generated by the Angular Service Worker. Therefore it will be ran after the build prod.

## Install

```shell
npm install -D @o3r/ngx-prefetch
```

## Builder options
  - `targetBuild` **Mandatory** The target build where prefetch should be applied. Used for identifying the `outputPath` of the build.

  - `resourceTypes` An object describing the resource types that should be prefetched.

  - `crossorigin` Flag that sets crossorigin attribute on links. If true it will be set for all prefetched resources.

  - `production` Flag for creating a production (minified) version of the js file or a development one.

  - `staticsFullPath` By default the prefetched resources are hosted next to the `ngxPrefetch.js` file, on the same server. If it is not the case, you can configure the full path of the resources that will be prefetched. (ex: https://my-web-app.com/path/to/my-app/). It is also possible to set this value by runtime. Instead of setting it in the Builder's options, you can search and replace for `{STATICS_FULL_PATH}` on the server side in order to inject a path.
## Usage

[`package.json`]

```json
    ...
    "build:prod": "ng build --prod && yarn run generate:prefetch",
    "generate:prefetch": "yarn app-name:generate-prefetch",
    ...
```

[`angular.json`]

```json
"generate-prefetch": {
    "builder": "@o3r/ngx-prefetch:run",
    "options": {
        "targetBuild": "my-app:build:production"
    }
},
```

[`angular.json`: full configuration]

```json
"generate-prefetch": {
    "builder": "@o3r/ngx-prefetch:run",
    "options": {
        "targetBuild": "my-app:build:production",
        "resourceTypes": {
            "image": ["png", "jpg", "gif"],
            "font": ["eot", "ttf", "woff", "woff2", "svg"],
            "style": ["css"],
            "script": ["js"],
            "document": ["html"]
        },
        "crossorigin": true,
        "production": false,
        "staticsFullPath": "https://my-web-app.com/path/to/my-app/"
    }
},
```

## Versioning 

This library is following the Angular release cycle. Angular 13 and onwards is supported.

For instance, if you are using Angular 13, use a 13.x version of the library:

```shell
npm install -D @o3r/ngx-prefetch@13
```
