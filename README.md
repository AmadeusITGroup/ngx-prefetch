# ngx-prefetch
Angular builder for prefetching resources before loading the application

## Description
There are some cases when application resources need to be prefetched before loading the app (ex. from the airline portal.)

The prefetch builder will create a `ngxPrefetch.js` file that, when executed, will dinamically [create `<link>` tags](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Link_prefetching_FAQ).

## Prerequisites
A prerequiste for the script is to have [Angular Service Worker](https://angular.io/guide/service-worker-intro) enabled as it is using the `ngsw.json` from the production build  folder that is generated by the Angular Service Worker. Therefore it will be ran after the build prod.

## Builder options
  - `targetBuild` **Mandatory** The target build where prefetch should be applied. Used for identifying the `outputPath` of the build.

  - `resourceTypes` An object describing the resource types that should be prefetched.

  - `crossorigin` Flag that sets crossorigin attribute on links. If true it will be set for all prefetched resources.

## Usage

[`package.json`]

```json
    ...
    "build:prod": "ng build --prod && yarn run generate:prefetch",
    "generate:prefetch": "yarn app-name:generate-prefetch",
    ...
```

[`angular.json`]

```json
"generate-prefetch": {
    "builder": "ngx-prefetch",
    "options": {
        "targetBuild": "my-app:build:production"
    }
},
```

[`angular.json`: full configuration]

```json
"generate-prefetch": {
    "builder": "ngx-prefetch",
    "options": {
        "targetBuild": "my-app:build:production",
